  - ECONOMY
  - The server economy is based on the 'Octain Economic Price-Guide'
  - Prices are calculated on effort required to obtain 1 stack.
  - However, items are slightly more expensive as singles.
  - The high prices are here to encourage players to create
  - their own economy, making it easier for player shops to thrive.
  - By using ChestShop and Auction house, we encourage players
  - to sell and buy items between each other using shops and auctions.
  - See "/ah help" to see how auctions work.
  - See the ChestShop examples below.

  - Why 'The Ice Box"?
  - IceBox is a Development term for a backlog
  - The Ice Box is a backlog of projects that
  - aren't going to be worked on any time soon.
  - Typiclly low priority bugs fall into this category, along with
  - low value but commonly requested features.
  - We move things into the icebox simple to declutter the backlog
  - to allow for higher priority tasks to be completed quicker.
  - An example you may come across would be commands that don't work
  - or otherwise give an error. In this case
  - simply contact an Admin and request the task is moved out of the icebox
